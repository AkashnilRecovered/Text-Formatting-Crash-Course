### Subscript and Superscript
To make your text underneath your sentence, first apply `<sub>` at the beginning of desired word of your sentence and `</sub>` at the end of the word of your sentence.

```
Output: I had a <sub>wonderful</sub> time on Discord
> [!NOTE]
> "``" was added between `<sub>` and `(</sub>)` for no clashing between sentences of the steps.
