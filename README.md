### Bold and nested italic
To make bold and nested italic, first apply two asterisks (**) at the first and last letter of your sentence, then apply two underscores (__) at the beginning and end of the desired word of your sentence.
Example:
```
**I had a _wonderful_ time on Discord**
```
Output: **I had a _wonderful_ time on Discord**
### Subscript and Superscript
To make your text below your sentence, first apply `<sub>` at the beginning of desired word of your sentence and `</sub>` at the end of the word of your sentence.
Example:
```
I had a <sub>wonderful</sub> time on Discord
```
Output: I had a <sub>wonderful</sub> time on Discord

To make your text above your sentence, first apply `<sup>` at the beat the beginning of desired word of your sentence and `</sup>` at the end of the word of your sentence.
Example:
```
I had a <sup>wonderful</sup> time on Discord
```
Output: I had a <sup>wonderful</sup> time on Discord
> [!NOTE]
> Two backticks (``) were added between `<sub>` and `< /sub >` and `< sup >` and `< /sup >` for no clashing between sentences of the steps.
## Text Formatting Level 2
### Quoting text
You can quote your text by applying greater than symbol (>) at the beginning of your sentence.
Example:
```
> I had a wonderful time on Discord
```
Output:

> I had a wonderful time on Discord
### Color models
To call out color models in your text, you can add color codes like `#ffffff` or `#000000` using backticks and a hashtag. (Might not work in README, only pull requests, disscussions, issues.)
Example:
```
The color for white is `#ffffff` and the color of black is `#000000`
```
Output: The color for white is `#ffffff` and the color of black is `#000000` (yes, it doesn't show the color next to it on a readme)

Color: HEX, RGB, HSL

Syntax:

For HEX: `#RRGGBB`

For RGB: `rgb(R,G,B)`

For HSL: `hsl(H,S,L)`

Example for given syntaxes:

HEX: `#0969DA`

RGB: `rgb(9, 105, 218)`

HSL: `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`

> [!NOTE]
> - A supported color model cannot have any leading or trailing spaces within the backticks.
> - The visualization of the color is only supported in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
### Text linking
To apply text linking (having a link in the text), apply brackets ([]) between the beginning and end of the words and brackets 2 (()) between the beginning and end of the link.
Example:
```
[Link to my GTA SA Modpack](https://github.com/AkashnilRecovered/AkashnilRecovered)
```
Output: [Link to my GTA SA Modpack](https://github.com/AkashnilRecovered/AkashnilRecovered)
### Header linking
To apply header linking, apply brackets ([]) between the beginning and end of the words and brackets 2 (()) between the beginning and end of the link. The link must have a hashtag at the beginning.
Example:
```
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
```
Output: [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
### Lists
